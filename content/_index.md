# Welcome! I'm Erin.

I invest at [Parable](https://parable.vc), partnering with founders as they build their magnum opus in consumer and prosumer AI.

## Adventures

In the past, I've:

* Scaled scientific moonshots at [Schmidt Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com) (funding frontier research and building high-risk science programs, Policy Entrepreneurs Network, expert-led philanthropic funds)
* Built FacePrint, AI for early detection of neurodegenerative disorders. Moved to SF at 18 to spin it out. Startup failed…best education.
* Conducted computational neuroscience research at Stanford, UCSF, MIT, Harvard.
* Worked in my first (official) lab at ten after years in my childhood kitchen lab
* Grew up middle child of five in Kansas, learned to be scrappy and root for underdogs

Whether through Mahler, brain imaging, or delightful user experiences, I'm drawn to ideas and people that spark awe.

I respond to cold emails and believe in people early. I love nerding out with people who are as earnest as they are ambitious, as imaginative as they are pragmatic, as kind as they are curious.

I've met some of my favorite people through [Interact](https://www.buildspace.so/), [Thiel Fellowship](https://www.thielfellowship.org/), [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/), and [RSI](https://www.cee.org/research-science-institute). I believe the best is still ahead.
